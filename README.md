# AngularJS_Manager_Inventory

This is an AngularJs project that allows users to interact with Customer's data from a table. Users can search for specific customers by typing customer's information in the search box. Data from Table can be sorted ascending and descending for Automated Testing purposes. Users can also add and delete customers. This project also has a form validation when user doesn't type name, lastname or age in the Pop Up Add Customer window. Finally a confirmation window has been added when user tries to delete a customer.
