# AngularJS_Manager_Inventory

This is an AngularJs project that allows users to interact with Customer's data from a table. Users can search for specific customers by typing customer's information in the search box. All of the data can be sorted in a descending or ascending order (Automated Testing purposes). Users can add and delete customers. This project has a form validation in case users don't type name, lastname or age in the Pop Up Add Customer window. Finally a confirmation window has been added when users try to delete a customer.
